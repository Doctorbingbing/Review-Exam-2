\section{Overview}
This is the first installment in a series of review exams to be taken before an exam to help solidify concepts and that can focus on problem areas in a simulated exam environment. This exam is broken up into three sections after which we will regroup and review what went wrong and what went right. In this review exams prior to the exam, this will act as a take home exam and we will review each question in depth at our next meeting. If for some reason you are unable to complete the exam, that is ok but I would like you to attempt all of the problems so that the issue is understanding and not that you didn't try.  

\section{Section 1: Differential Equations}
Solve each question by separating variables \\\\
1)$$ \frac{dy}{dx} = 6y^2x $$
\newpage
2)$$\frac{dr}{d\theta} = e^{-r}(2\theta - 4) $$
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
\begin{centering}b) Find the particular solution if r(0) = 5\end{centering}\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
3) CHALLENGE$$y' = e^{y-t}sec(y)(1+t^2) y(0)= 0 $$
\newpage
\section{Section 2: Volume of Solids of Revolution}
4)Find the volume of the region bounded by $y=3x$ between $x=0$ and $x=3$ when revolved around the x-axis.
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
5)Find the volume of the region bounded by $y=\sqrt{x}$ and $y=e^x$ when revolved around the x-axis
\newpage
6) CHALLENGE
Find the volume of the region bounded by $y=x^2-4x$ and $y=x$ about the line y=6.
